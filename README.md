# hello-world
My name is Andrea, and this is my first repository!

Although I come from an arts and humanities background (I have two degrees in literature), I am also passionate about learning new things, ranging from languages to building new systems. 
I am now pursuing a certificate in digital marketing, and also working on developing my coding skills. 
Life is a journey, where I want to constantly learn new things. This is why I joined Github, and I can't wait to see what is in store for me here!
